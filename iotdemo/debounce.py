"""
Robust debounce decorator for callbacks like GPIO interrupts.

Features:
- Leading / trailing edge control
- Optional max_wait (force-fire) to avoid indefinite deferral
- Per-key debounce (e.g., per-pin) for shared handlers
- Thread-safe (uses Lock), time.monotonic() for steady-time
- Drop-in compatible with previous debounce(wait_sec) usage

    """
    Debounce a function so that it’s not called too frequently.

    Args:
        wait_sec: Quiet period length. Calls within this window are coalesced.
        leading:  If True, call immediately on the first call in a burst.
        trailing: If True, call after the burst “settles” for wait_sec.
        max_wait: Force a call if this many seconds have elapsed since the
                  last *invocation* (helps for steady streams).
        key:      Per-key debounce. A function that maps (*args, **kwargs) to a
                  hashable key (e.g., lambda pin, *_: pin). If None, a single
                  global bucket is used.
        clock:    Time source; default is time.monotonic().

    Notes:
        - If both leading and trailing are True:
            * first call in a burst fires immediately,
            * further calls delay a trailing fire until wait_sec after the last call,
            * but a trailing fire is skipped if there were no calls after the leading fire.
        - If only leading is True => at most one call per burst, immediate.
        - If only trailing is True => only the last call args are used.
        - If max_wait is set, a call is forced at most every max_wait seconds.
